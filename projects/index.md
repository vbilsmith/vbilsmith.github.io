I am currently interested in speaking to students who are interested in machine learning classification, specifically in terms of either natural langauge processing or image processing. 
A love for animals is always a plus!

Current research projects in the lab include:
- Analysis of metadata in RNA-Seq repositories
- Meta-analysis of RNA-Seq from repositories
- Comparing diversity in genomic data collected from different populations
